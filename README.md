# readme-generator
This project uses the inquirer node module to prompt users to answers questions. A question must be inputed in order to recieve a new prompt. Once the questions are answered an GGithub api call is placed to receive you picture, email, and repository. A new file is created called indexREADME.md with all the answers and data display neatly.
